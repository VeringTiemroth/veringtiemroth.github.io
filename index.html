										<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I enjoy complex and strange challenges and thrive on getting them solved. I am structured, quality-oriented, and independent, and take responsibility and meet deadlines. 
											I am accustomed to the fact that most days are unpredictable, tasks and projects may vary, and sudden ad hoc tasks may land on my table for quick prioritization.</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>I have strong technical expertise in Microsoft technologies, including Microsoft Active Directory, GPOs, Security Groups, PKI infrastructure, and various Windows Server and Client versions. I'm also well-versed in Microsoft 365 administration, Azure cloud management, and Hyper-V Virtualization. I possess experience in defensive IT security and have worked within ISO27001 and ITIL environments.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>I'm 52 years old, married to Maiken, and we have two boys, age 15 and 19, and Balder the beagle. I'm a 25-year jubilee at Roskilde Festival, so yes, I really like experiencing live music. Besides music, I genuinely enjoy hanging out with my family and friends. 
                                        I have not yet started on Mad Men, Breaking Bad, or the Sopranos, but I do like a good movie or binge a tv-show when I'm not trying to keep up with all the changes that embrace the IT world today.</p>

									<p><b>Omada, October 2016 to present.</b> Since joining Omada in 2016, I’ve progressed through roles from IT Specialist to IT Manager, and since April 2022, IT Director. Over the years, I’ve led the transformation of our IT operations—from managing a hybrid infrastructure to completing a full migration to a cloud-only environment based on Microsoft Azure. I played a central role in a comprehensive infrastructure rebuild on Hyper-V, implemented modern security frameworks including Conditional Access Policies, MFA, Microsoft Intune Security Baselines, Azure AD, and Omada Identity Cloud for identity and access management, and restructured our internal helpdesk to improve processes and efficiency. We also implemented a global SASE solution using Cato Networks, providing secure, optimized access for all users regardless of location. Together with my team, I’ve driven continuous improvement initiatives focused on strengthening security and scalability. I’ve also contributed to the successful implementation and three recertifications of our ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System, as well as two SOC 2 Type II audits, ensuring high standards of compliance and operational excellence.<br>
