										<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I enjoy complex and strange challenges and thrive on getting them solved. I am structured, quality oriented, independent, and I take responsibility and meet deadlines. 
                                    I am accustomed to the fact that most days are unpredictable, tasks and projects may vary, and sudden ad hoc tasks may land on my table for a quick prioritization.</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>I possess technological know-how and experience. I have a deep knowledge of Microsoft Active Directory, GPOs, Security Groups, PKI infrastructure, 
										all versions of Windows Server and Clients. Strong knowledge of Office 365 administration, Azure cloud management and Hyper-V Virtualization.
                                    I have a good understanding and strong interest for defensive IT security and I have experience working in a ISO27001 and ITIL environment</p>

										I have not yet started on Mad Men, Breaking Bad or the Sopranos, but I do like a good movie or to binge a tv-show when I'm not trying to keep 
                                        up with all the changes that embrace the IT world today.</p>
